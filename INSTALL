# Installing media explorer

The project is autotooled, so if you have the right dependencies
and build tools you can build and install it with:

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=$PREFIX
  make
  make install

where $PREFIX is the root directory to install into (default: /).

*** media explorer is only confirmed to work on Linux so far ***

However, the dependencies may well trip you up, as there are quite
a few, and mostly at very recent versions. It's unlikely your distro
will support them out of the box (unless you're running a _very_
recent or alpha distro).

For this reason, the most reliable installation technique is to
use jhbuild-mex, available from:

  https://github.com/media-explorer/jhbuild-mex

jhbuild is a tool for building a project and its dependencies
in an isolated environment, enabling you to
use specific versions of libraries without messing up your operating
system.

Follow the jhbuild-mex README to use it to install and run
media explorer.
